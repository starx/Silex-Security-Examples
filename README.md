# Task list

## Problem Definition

One of the projects we are working on internally is a project management system. This is a very big project and for each section of the software, we prototype and demonstrate it to all the stakeholders before implementing it finally. This task consists of one of those prototypes and it is about showing the list of tasks.

A prototype for this was created by one of our team members using Slim Framework with Twig as a templating engine. The prototype has received positive feedback from our stakeholders and we would like to implement it properly.

## Task

Using the prototype as a reference, create a full-stack application by separating the backend and frontend correctly. Implement the backend as an API that will facilitate the frontend and implement the frontend as a PWA which consumes the backend API.

The backend is very basic to support the minimum requirements of the prototype. Its design is poor and hacky and does not consist of a database as well. When implementing the backend as an API, correct these shortcomings.

The frontend is currently built using Twig. Understand the implementation and reimplement them as components in your PWA. 

You can continue using the prototype and refactor it into a final solution or you can start fresh. The recommended tech stack is provided below.

## Extended Goals (optional)

The backend currently only has an implementation for facilitating the listing of tasks, the front-end however shows many actions you can perform in a task (such as CRUD) that the backend can't support yet. Implement them to build a more complete application.

## What we look at

This task is designed to give us an idea of:

- your competency to work as a full-stack developer.
  - your backend skills
  - your frontend skills
  - how well you test your implementation. 
 
- your system design
	
  - your understanding of Object-oriented principles, such as SOLID.
  - your database design
  - your UI design
  - your component design
  - your understanding of test methodologies like TDD or BDD for both backend and frontend.

- your ability to work as a team member collaborating to reach an end goal. 

- your problem-solving skills
  - how well can you envision various use cases and incorporate them into your design.
  - how well you are able to understand the prototype and convert it into a proper full-stack application.
  - how well you can recognise shortcomings of the prototype
  - how well you can recognise bad practices and correct them.

## Requirements

1. Provide a README file containing clear, simple instructions on how to install and execute the project and its tests.
2. If anything needs clarification that is not detailed here, ask us the question.
3. If you have made assumptions then note this in the README file.
4. If you have not implemented some required features due to reasons such as lack of time, then note them in the README file.
5. Be prepared to suggest to us what the next steps of the project could or should be.


## Deliverables

Once complete, send over a zip of the source code or link to the git repo.

## Recommended technology stack 

- Backend: 
  - PHP (But Python or Node is acceptable)
  - MySQL
  - Redis Or Memcached (If required)
- Frontend
  - JS (ES6+) with TypeScript
  - Vue Js or React Js
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
